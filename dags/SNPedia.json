The polymorphic variant risk for Venous Thromboembolism was overall OR: 4.38. The risk was greater in younger subjects (<45 years old, OR: 5.43; \u226545 years old, OR: 3.71). Slightly higher risk appeared in men (OR: 5.06) and in women taking oral contraceptives (OR: 6.10). The AG polymorphic variant was associated with recurrent thrombosis (recurrent VTE event, OR: 5.81; no recurrence reported, OR: 3.95). The higher risks were for venous thrombosis without evidence of pulmonary embolism (OR: 4.49) or a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (OR: 4.14). The AA homozygous variant was rarer, and its risk was significantly higher at 11.45 but was based on fewer individuals (116 subjects among cases and 24 controls). Independent risk was seen in variants of the PT20210A or Factor 2 SNP at i3002432 (also known as rs1799963 )"
